# 1137. N-th Tribonacci Number

The Tribonacci sequence `Tn` is defined as follows:

- T₀ = 0  
- T₁ = 1  
- T₂ = 1  
- Tₙ₊₃ = Tₙ + Tₙ₊₁ + Tₙ₊₂ for n ≥ 0  

Given `n`, return the value of `Tn`.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```
n = 4
```

**Output:**
```
4
```

**Explanation:**
```
T₃ = 0 + 1 + 1 = 2  
T₄ = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```
n = 25
```

**Output:**
```
1389537
```

## Constraints

- 0 ≤ n ≤ 37  
- The answer is guaranteed to fit within a 32-bit integer (`<= 2³¹ - 1`)
